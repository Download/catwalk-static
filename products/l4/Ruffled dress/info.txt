Ruffled wool-blend mini dress

Alexander McQueen's red mini dress has been made in Italy from wool-blend scuba – softly structured, it holds the shape of the ruffled shoulders and hem beautifully. 
The nipped-in waist and sculpting seam details are equally flattering.
Keep the bold hue in focus with neutral accessories.
